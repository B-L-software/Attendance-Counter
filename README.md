# Attendance-Counter

This application is made for taking meeting attendance from zoom polls.  It also organizes each congregation member into service groups and is used to detect
when someone misses a meeting so that it is easier to keep track over zoom.  This will allow elders to better shepard the flock.  For each meeting, the user must download
both the poll from that particular zoom meeting and the active hosts under zoom account reports.

Then the downloaded information can be imported into this program and the program will sort the info and break it down into service groups and meeting attendance.  
A video tutorial is available for all those interested.
